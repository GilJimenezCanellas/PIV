# Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) Projects

This repository contains two projects focused on **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)**, utilizing different techniques for image characterization and retrieval from extensive databases.

## Project 1: Histogram-Based CBIR System
This project investigates a **CBIR algorithm** that utilizes **histogram-based descriptors** to represent and retrieve digital images. The system applies computer vision techniques to efficiently handle image retrieval challenges.

### Key Features:
- **Histogram-Based Descriptors**: Images are characterized by their histograms, summarizing the pixel intensity distributions.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Quantitative metrics such as **F-measure** and **computational cost** are used to assess the algorithm's effectiveness.
- **Insights Provided**: The study explores the effectiveness and efficiency of the histogram-based CBIR system for real-world image retrieval tasks.

## Project 2: CSD-Based CBIR System
Building on the first project, this system incorporates **Color Structure Descriptor (CSD)** from **MPEG-7** to enhance image retrieval by leveraging color information.

### Key Features:
- **Color Structure Descriptor (CSD)**: Images are represented using the CSD feature, which captures both color content and spatial layout.
- **Comparison with Histogram-Based System**: The project evaluates the performance of the CSD-based CBIR system relative to the histogram-based approach.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Similar to the first project, metrics such as **F-measure** and **computational cost** are used to compare systems.
- **Findings**: 
  - The CSD-based system improves retrieval accuracy.
  - The trade-off is a slight increase in computational cost.
  - The study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating color descriptors into CBIR systems.
